# 🔢 Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning 🤖

In this project, we explore the fascinating world of computer vision and deep learning by tackling the challenge of handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The uploaded documents provide a comprehensive approach to building, training, and evaluating a CNN model for this task, leveraging the powerful capabilities of TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📚 Document Overview

1. **`handwritten digit recognition - Colab.pdf`**: A PDF snapshot of a Google Colab notebook, showcasing the entire code implementation and execution.
2. **`handwritten_digit_recognition.py`**: The Python script containing the same code as the PDF file, making it easy to run and modify locally.

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture

The core of this project lies in the `create_model()` function, which defines the CNN architecture for handwritten digit recognition. The model consists of the following layers:

- 🔺 Three Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation, responsible for extracting low-level and high-level features from the input images.
- ⬇️ Max Pooling Layers, used for downsampling the feature maps and reducing computational complexity.
- 🔳 Flattening Layer, which converts the multi-dimensional feature maps into a flat vector.
- 🔲 Two Fully Connected Layers with ReLU and Softmax activations, respectively, for combining the extracted features and generating the final classification output.

## 🔑 Key Functions

1. **`load_mnist()`**: Loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images and their corresponding labels.
2. **`train_and_evaluate_model()`**: This function is the powerhouse of the project. It handles various crucial tasks, including:
   - 🔘 Normalization of pixel values to the range [0, 1].
   - 🔷 Reshaping input images to include the channel dimension required by CNNs.
   - 🔨 Model compilation with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
   - 🏋️‍♀️ Training the model on the provided data for a specified number of epochs.
   - 📐 Evaluation of the trained model on the test data, reporting the test accuracy.
3. **`visualize_predictions()`**: This function allows us to visualize the model's predictions on a subset of test images. It displays the input image, predicted label, and whether the prediction is correct (indicated by green 🟢) or incorrect (indicated by red 🔴).

## 📊 Evaluation and Testing

The code provides a comprehensive evaluation and testing process for the trained model. During training, the loss and accuracy metrics are printed for each epoch, allowing us to monitor the model's performance. After training, the final test accuracy is calculated and displayed, giving us an objective measure of the model's generalization capability.

In the provided example, the trained model achieves an impressive test accuracy of approximately 0.9919 or 99.19% 🏆, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.

## 📥 Running the Code

To run the code locally, simply execute the `handwritten_digit_recognition.py` script. The script will automatically load the MNIST dataset, train the CNN model, and visualize the predictions on a subset of test images.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

While the current implementation achieves excellent results, there are always opportunities for improvement and exploration. Some potential areas for future enhancements include:

- 🔍 Experimenting with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to further improve the model's performance.
- 🌐 Applying transfer learning techniques by leveraging pre-trained models on larger datasets.
- 🖼️ Extending the project to recognize handwritten characters or symbols beyond digits.
- 🌐 Integrating the model into a web application or mobile app for real-world deployment.
